Having the ability to write quality code is essential for 
your professional success. The importance of well-written code cannot be 
overstated: it is easier to read and maintain, leading to increased 
productivity and reduced costs for businesses.
In this article, I will share my favorite code quality books 
that have helped me improve my skills and learn best practices for writing
clean, efficient, and maintainable code. These books are widely known, 
many of the principles from them are now universally applied, 
and I believe they have the potential to benefit developers 
of all skill levels.

## Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code

Authors: Martin Fowler, Don Roberts, John Brant, William Opdyke, Kent Beck

First published: 2000

{{< img "refactoring.jpg" "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code book cover" >}}

Refactoring is one of the main skills every developer should learn. 
This book describes what it is, how to do it, and the main types of refactoring.

Doing refactoring regularly is not only useful to increase the productivity of
working on the code, but it is also very pleasant: refactoring leaves behind 
satisfaction, the feeling that the code has become much more readable and clean.

I highly recommend this book.

## Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

Authors: Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides

First published: 1994

Knowing patterns is worthwhile not only because they make design easier, but 
also because they provide developers with a common language and set of standard
solutions to common design problems. They help you think about design problems
in a more structured way.

The Design Patterns book, like Refactoring, is not so much a tutorial as 
it is a catalog that can be consulted regularly while you work.

## Code Complete

Author: Steve McConnell

First published: 1993

{{< img "code-complete.jpg" "Code Complete book cover" >}}

It's hard to imagine a list of books on writing high-quality code without 
Code Complete. This is a monumental work that covers all aspects of programming, 
from tips on self-documenting code, to recommendations on how best to use 
the if statement.

The book is voluminous, but nevertheless I recommend everyone to read 
at least those parts that you will find necessary.

## The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master

Authors: Andy Hunt, Dave Thomas

First published: 1999

{{< img "the-pragmatic-programmer.jpg" "The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master book cover" >}}

Definitely my favorite book on this list. The Pragmatic Programmer contains 
high-level advice, general principles, and wise metaphors that you yourself 
can apply in your work. For example, it was this book that introduced 
the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

Every piece of advice in this book is worth its weight in gold, and 
I highly recommend that all developers read it several times.

## Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change

Author: Kent Beck

First published: 1999

{{< img "extreme-programming-explained.jpg" "Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change book cover" >}}

Extreme Programming is a methodology, so unlike the other books on this list, 
this book also deals with project management. Nevertheless, it contains a large
number of tips and techniques that can and should be applied to improve code 
quality. Therefore, I advise you to read Extreme Programming regardless of 
whether this methodology or its individual parts are used in your workplace.

## Test-Driven Development: By Example

Author: Kent Beck

First published: 2002

{{< img "test-driven-development.jpg" "Test-Driven Development: By Example book cover" >}}

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a brilliant approach in its simplicity and
efficiency that solves a huge number of problems simultaneously: 
it reduces human factor, increases test coverage, speeds up and simplifies
development due to your confidence in the code, the confidence that your changes 
will not break anything and the code will work; it allows you to 
make more convenient programming interfaces and 
structures in your head the idea of what your code will be like.

I strongly recommend that you read this book and 
try to apply its advice to your work for a while -- you won't regret it.

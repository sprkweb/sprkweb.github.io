overstated: it is easier to read and maintain, leading to increased
productivity and reduced costs for businesses.

clean, efficient, and maintainable code. These books are widely known,
many of the principles from them are now universally applied,

of all skill levels.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Image processing in Hugo</title><link>https://www.sprkweb.dev/en/posts/hugo-image-processing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sprkweb.dev/en/posts/hugo-image-processing/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">image processing system&lt;/a>

and functional, but it also has a simple interface that allows you to
customize it with a few lines of code. It also supports
&lt;a href="%28https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/%29">WebP&lt;/a>,
an image format that I also really like.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Development history: Octava Page</title><link>https://www.sprkweb.dev/en/posts/octava-page/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sprkweb.dev/en/posts/octava-page/</guid><description>&lt;p>Octava Page is a web application for novice musicians
